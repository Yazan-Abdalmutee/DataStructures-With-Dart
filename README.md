# Data Structures in Dart: Stack and Linked List Challenges

This repository showcases implementations of stack and linked list data structures in Dart, along with solutions to  challenges and algorithms.

---

## 🗂️ Stack-Based Questions

### 1. Reverse a List Using a Stack
This function demonstrates how to reverse the elements of a list using a stack. It pushes all elements onto the stack and then pops them in reverse order.

### 2. Check Balanced Parentheses
This function checks if the parentheses in a given string are balanced using a stack.

## 🗂️ Linked List Challenges

### 1. Print a Linked List in Reverse
Recursively prints the elements of a linked list in reverse order.

### 2. Find the Middle Node of a Linked List
Uses a two-pointer technique (`slow` and `fast`) to locate the middle node of the linked list.

### 3. Reverse a Linked List
Iteratively reverses the linked list.

### 4. Remove All Occurrences of a Target Value
Removes all occurrences of a specified value from the linked list.
