# Data Structures in Dart: Stack and Linked List Challenges

This repository showcases implementations of stack and linked list data structures in Dart, along with solutions to common challenges and algorithms. Each section includes detailed examples and explanations.

## 🗂️ Stack-Based Questions

### 1. Reverse a List Using a Stack
This function demonstrates how to reverse the elements of a list using a stack. It pushes all elements onto the stack and then pops them in reverse order.

### 2. Check Balanced Parentheses
This function checks if the parentheses in a given string are balanced using a stack. It ensures that each opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis.

## 🗂️ Linked List Challenges

### 1. Print a Linked List in Reverse
Recursively prints the elements of a linked list in reverse order. This approach highlights the use of recursion to traverse the list backward.

### 2. Find the Middle Node of a Linked List
Uses a two-pointer technique (`slow` and `fast`) to efficiently locate the middle node of the linked list.

### 3. Reverse a Linked List
Iteratively reverses the linked list. This operation updates the `next` pointers of the nodes to reverse the direction of the list.

### 4. Remove All Occurrences of a Target Value
Removes all occurrences of a specified value from the linked list. This includes handling cases where the target value is at the head of the list.
